> A little site to show off my code!

## idea

z index seperates poster images, as you scroll it flips through them, each one with a project on it.
(have a small dot based system for jumping between)
keep to pure github atm, the live sites need work yikes.
keep same text element at highest z index, animate it clearing and retyping on scroll. (pretty quickily)


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
